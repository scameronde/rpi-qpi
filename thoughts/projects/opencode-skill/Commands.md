## Research

I want to create a new skill for OpenCode (not ClaudeCode).

The skill should have all the knowledge about creating skills and agents for OpenCode (not ClaudeCode). The skill should also have the knowledge about prompt generation, editing, improvement and evaluation for building agents for OpenCode (opencode.ai). 

OpenCode is similar to ClaudeCode. 

You can read all about Skills for OpenCode here: https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/ 

You can read about OpenCode here: https://opencode.ai/docs/ 

You can read about how to build Agents for OpenCode here: https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/  . I want the agents to be build with the Markdown format.

You can read about ClaudeCode on the internet. 

The prompts should be optimized for working with Anthropic Claude Sonnet-4.5 model (not 3.5, not 4.0, not 4.1, just version 4.5). 

Research all the information necessary to build such a skill and write a research report. 

ATTENTION: the files in this project - especially the skills and the agents - should NOT be used as input, because their quality have not been evaluated.

## Plan

I want to create a new skill for OpenCode (not ClaudeCode).

The skill should have all the knowledge about creating skills and agents for OpenCode (not ClaudeCode). The skill should also have the knowledge about prompt generation, editing, improvement and evaluation for building agents for OpenCode (opencode.ai). 

OpenCode is similar to ClaudeCode. 

You can find the results of an extensive research here: thoughts/shared/research/2026-01-17-OpenCode-Skills-and-Agent-Development.md

ATTENTION: the files in this project - especially the skills and the agents - should NOT be used as input, because their quality have not been evaluated.

Create a plan for realizing this new skill

## QA Agent

Read the quality agent "agent/python-qa-thorough.md". I need another quality test agent, that is not specialized in Python but in Agents and Skills for OpenCode. The skill "opencode" has all the knowledge the new opencode-qa-thorough agent needs.
Create a plan for realizing the opencode-qa-thorough agent. Use the opencode skill.
