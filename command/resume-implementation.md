We are resuming the implementation session. Follow this protocol to synchronize your context:

1.  **Locate Context Files:** Find the `RESUME-HERE.md` file and the corresponding `[Plan-Name]-PROGRESS.md` file in the workspace.
2.  **Ingest State:** Read both files thoroughly. Pay special attention to the "Next Steps" and "Agent Instructions" sections.
3.  **Verify Environment:** Run the "Quick Start" verification commands listed in `RESUME-HERE.md`. Confirm that the files created in the previous session are present and valid.
4.  **Acknowledge & Sync:** Output a brief "Session Initialized" summary containing:
    *   **Current Position:** Which PLAN item you are starting now.
    *   **State Check:** Confirm that you have verified the previous work.
    *   **Plan of Attack:** A 2-3 sentence summary of the immediate code changes you are about to make for the current task.
5.  **Ready:** End your response by asking: "Should I begin with [Next Plan Item] now?"
